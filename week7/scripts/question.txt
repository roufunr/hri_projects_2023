We simulated the same experiment explained in this paper (paper.pdf) and we used this dataset and it's description given in readme.txt file. 
In this experiment, we only worked on these joint datas to observe the movement of NAO robots. 
I've attached a sample.csv with this. After getting the result from DL model, we ran the data on NAO robot using code.py. 
After implementing this, we take survey data from 20 people. And this is in survey.pdf. 

1. Generate a 2-3 page report that explains the experiment as well as adds the chart to the report and give a proper conclusion based on how much we can replicate the mentioned paper. 
2. Generate a short pptx which contains experiment design, dataset description, survey questions, survey result anaylsis and conclusion.
